Character generator:

DONE
1. Write the base character creator/generator as an independent library that I can use in conjunction any editor/framework, preferrably as a single header library

DONE:
2. Decide on an open source framework to use to and implement and editor for the character creator/generator in said framework
- (DONE) imgui
- (DONE) Have set up all boilerplate needed for my needed ui elements
- (DONE) Have almost finished the class menu



- (DONE )All menus can be closed from wihtin themselves, setting up the menu bar now 
- (DONE) Afterwards, create a bar menu where any of the 3 editors can be opened


- (DONE) Overhaul of how callbacks are set up as-well as well as how element widget handling is set up
-- 'Templates' keep elements, elements now are event based and will never miss deselecting/selecting


- (DONE) Then finish up the character and race menu
- (DONE) Nlohmnn now works as intended and outputs our created classes, races and characters to file, as-well as fix outstream not being called properly


Major overhaul, removed nlohmanns json library, partially hand-rolled a new solution
- Removed Nlohmanns json library. it is very inconsistent and was not able to parse the files it itself has created. Atleast on windows it is fickle to say the best 
--- This ended up with a number of hours rueing the day nlohmann was created and then after resigning myself to use it I then replacing it with a much more bare bones json parser, 
--- The bare-bones parser is in vendors now, and it required me to hand-roll much of the serialization and deserialization for our Classes, Races and Character myself. this has been perfectly reliable however and we can consume our own creates jsons

Other:
- Fix Alignment chart, remove hacky 3x3 setup and just calculate a max width to force it to be 3x3
- Wrote code to handle threading of the scan in rsc/savedata for scanning our classes/races/characters and load them before anything else
- Write a widget which allows us to select a loaded character config into our character editor
- Refactored the payloads to be their own struct type, as most functions shared the same input parameters
- bind events to buttons which need it but might not have it yet 
- SerializeAbilityScores implemented now
- Some editor types inherit from a shared type named BaseCharacterEditorClass, mainly as a form of tagging
- Actually seed with a valid time based seed, currently only teh default seed is being used which is the same everytime


IN PROGRESS: 
- 3. If I have time, extend or polish the character creator editors
--- (DONE) Large overhaul: I started abstracting away the ugly push/pop pattern of the styles into a wrapper class, code looks much cleaner and saner now
--- (DONE) Split up editor widgets into their own file (editor_widgets.h/cpp) and kept the other types in widgets.h/cpp
--- (TODO) Add additional features like character bio?

BACKLOG:
- 4. If I have any time left over, implement it in with alternative frameworks or engines?
