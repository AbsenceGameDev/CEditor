Character generator:

DONE
1. Write the base character creator/generator as an independent library that I can use in conjunction any editor/framework, preferrably as a single header library

IP-ROGRESS:
2. Decide on an open source framework to use to and implement and editor for the character creator/generator in said framework
- (DONE) imgui
- (DONE) Have set up all boilerplate needed for my needed ui elements
- (DONE) Have almost finished the class menu

- (DONE )All menus can be closed from wihtin themselves, setting up the menu bar now 
- (DONE) Afterwards, create a bar menu where any of the 3 editors can be opened


- (DONE) Overhaul of how callbacks are set up as-well as well as how element widget handling is set up
-- 'Templates' keep elements, elements now are event based and will never miss deselecting/selecting


- (DONE) Then finish up the character and race menu
- (DONE) Nlohmnn now works as intended and outputs our created classes, races and characters to file, as-well as fix outstream not being called properly


TODO:
- (TODO) Scan rsc&saved for class/race/character configs and load them before anything else
- (TODO) Actually seed with a valid time based seed, currently only teh default seed is being used which is the same everytime


3. If I have time, extend the character creator/generator library as suggested by the test instructions
4. If I have any time left over, implement it in with alternative frameworks or engines? 






Last Commmit:



- Bound some missing events for the stat selectors in the different menus
- Fixed nlohmann misusage
