Character generator:

TODO:
(DONE)    1. Write the base character creator/generator as an independent library that I can use in conjunction any editor/framework, preferrably as a single header library

(TODO)    2. Decide on an open source framework to use to and implement and editor for the character creator/generator in said framework

(BACKLOG) 3. If I have time, extend the character creator/generator library as suggested by the test instructions

(BACKLOG) 4. If I have any time left over, implement it in with alternative frameworks or engines?
